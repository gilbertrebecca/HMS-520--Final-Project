# HMS-520--Final-Project

Group members:
Asrat Arja Wolde
Rebecca Gilbert
Susan Campbell

Format: 
Option 3 - analyzing a dataset that uses data wrangling and modeling tools in R

Goals:
We want to better understand how indicators of social vulnerability covary by U.S. state and, within the state of Washington, by county.
CDC provides an excellent compiliation of indicators related to vulnerability, pulled from the U.S. census.
We will first read CDC's documentation about the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to gain familiarity with the variables.
Next, we will read in data, select variables of interest, and peforme data cleaning and checks.
We will produce some simple visuals (maybe including violin plots and others) and summary stats to orient ourselves to the data.
Then we will choose some analyses of interest and develop models to investigate them. 
We will consider linear regression and linear mixed effects modeling primarily, and will also consider logistic regression if appropriate. 
Finally, we will develop visuals (likely scatterplots) to show model fit and produce any appropriate summaries.
Woohoo!
